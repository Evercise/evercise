                  <p><a name="a283201">6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will confirm our acceptance to you by sending you an e-mail (<strong>Email Confirmation</strong>).&nbsp; The Contract between us will only be formed when we send you the Email Confirmation. </a></p>

                  <p>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reserve the right to amend these Terms from time to time. Please look at the top of this page to see when these Terms were last updated and which Terms were changed.</p>

                  <p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time you order Packages from us, the Terms in force at the time of your order will apply to the Contract between you and us.</p>

                  <p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right to Cancel during the Cooling-off period</p>

                  <p>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are a consumer, you have a legal right to cancel a Contract under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 within 14 days of receiving the Email Confirmation (&ldquo;<strong>Cooling-Off Period</strong>&rdquo;) provided that you have not used the Package to which the Email Confirmation relates.&nbsp; This means that during the Cooling-Off Period if you change your mind or decide for any other reason that you do not want keep a Package, you can notify us of your decision to cancel the Contract and receive a refund. Advice about your legal right to cancel the Contract is available from your local Citizens&#39; Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office.</p>

                  <p>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>However, this cancellation right does not apply where you use the Package within the Cooling-Off Period.</strong> For the purpose of these Terms, &ldquo;<em>use the Package</em>&rdquo; means using a Package to book a Class on our site.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, once a Class has been booked using a Package, then that Package will deemed to be used, regardless of whether you actually attend or cancel your attendance for that Class.</p>

                  <p><strong>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Where you use the Package within the Cooling-Off Period, you:</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>agree and accept that you have requested that the supply of the service should begin during the Cooling-Off Period;</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>acknowledge that your legal cancellation rights will be lost as soon as the Package is used.</strong></p>

                  <p>8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cancel a Contract, you just need to let us know that you have decided to cancel. The easiest way to do this is to complete the cancellation form user dashboard<em> </em>on our site. A link to the cancellation form will be included in our Email Confirmation. If you use this method we will e-mail you to confirm we have received your cancellation.</p>

                  <p>8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also e-mail us at <a href="mailto:contact@evercise.com">contact@evercise.com</a>. If you are e-mailing us please include details of your order to help us to identify it. If you send us your cancellation notice by e-mail, then your cancellation is effective from the date you send us the e-mail.</p>

                  <p>8.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you cancel your Contract we will:</p>

                  <p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refund you the price you paid for the Packages; and</p>

                  <p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make any refunds due to you as soon as possible and in any event within 14 days after you inform us of your decision to cancel the Contract.</p>

                  <p>8.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will refund you on the credit card or debit card used by you to pay. If you used your Evercise Balance to pay for the Packages we may refund you in Evercise Balance.</p>

                  <p>8.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree and accept that there will be no right of cancellation of refund outside of the Cooling-Off Period.</p>

                  <p>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prices of the Packages will be as quoted on our site at the time you submit your order. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices of Packages are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered onto the system. However please see <em>clause </em><em>9.3</em> for what happens if we discover an error in the price of Package(s) you ordered.</p>

                  <p>9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prices for our Packages may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any order you have already placed.</p>

We will not process your order until we have your instructions. If we are unable to contact you using the contact details you provided during the order process, we will treat the order as cancelled and notify you in writing. Please note that if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing, we do not have to provide the Packages to you at the incorrect (lower) price.</p>

                  <p>9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prices of the Packages are exclusive of any applicable Transaction Fees that may be payable by you to our third party payment providers.</p>

                  <p>13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may transfer our rights and obligations under a Contract to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms. We will always notify you by posting on this webpage if this happens.</p>

                  <p>13.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise.</p>

                  <p>13.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>

                  <p>13.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>

                  <p>13.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These Terms are governed by English law. This means a Contract for the purchase of Packages through our site and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it will be governed by English law.
