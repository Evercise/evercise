                        <strong>Basics about Evercise</strong><br><br>
                        <p>Evercise is an online platform that connects everyone wanting to exercise in a class with a wide array of instructors and classes all over London.<br><br>
                        With Evercise, you can choose your class by location, provider and specificity. Once

						booked, you will receive automatic confirmation of your booking with all the necessary

						details. When an instructor creates an event on Evercise, only maximum participant’s 

						numbers are required and the instructor is obliged to perform the class even if only one 

						person has enrolled.<br><br>
						All classes on the Evercise site whether big or small will consist of various tags chosen 

						by the event creator, the Instructor and provider. These aid the participant to fasten 

						the search for their preferred interest (s). All classes on the site will be screened and 

						available for all to see.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a name="accountability"><div class="faq_gap"></div></a>
                        <strong>Instructor and participant accountability</strong><br><br>
                        <p>Evercise will strive to lower the risks for all participants by screening professionals 

						upon signing-up, provide an instructor rating system with comments for participants to 

						have their say (good or bad) and for any complaints/queries to be dealt with as soon 

						as possible. Evercise cannot guarantee all events will run accordingly but ensures all 

						participants can ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a group by whether 

						they decide to join it or not.<br><br>
						It's the instructor’s responsibility to provide and complete their class in a professional 

						manner. Evercise is not directly responsible or involved in providing the professionals

						service themselves.<br><br>
						We encourage all our instructors to upload their website details in order to demonstrate 

						their accountability.<br><br>
						Evercise's ‘Terms of Use’ require instructors to fulfil all services of their class or refund 

						any and all participants whose service they did not or cannot fulfil (All instructors will 

						see these terms before they confirm the class details). These terms are to create a legal 

						requirement for instructors/creators to follow through on their provision of classes and 

						services.<br><br>
						Evercise doesn't issue refunds as transactions are between participants and the 

						instructor directly. Instructors receive all funds (minus Evercise’s minimal fee) soon 

						after their class has been performed. Instructors have the ability to refund participants 

						through PayPal and Evercise. We advise participants who are unsuccessful in claiming a 

						refund owed to them to contact Evercise directly.</p>

                        —You must be 18 years of age or older.<br><br>

                        A verified PayPal account is required for all participants, this will revert to the choice of

						to set up your account when you complete your profile (unless you already have an 

						account with PayPal). For any PayPal payment questions, please visit the PayPal site or 

						contact us.</p>

                        <p>Once your class (s) have been submitted, a group specialist in association with Evercise

						will review it against our ‘Class Guideline. We will let you know if it's suitable for the site, 

						needs a little work or if doesn’t meet the requirements of Evercise. We'll get back to you 

						within two working days on average and if changes are required. We will let you know 

						and then re-review your group once it’s been updated. We recommend instructors to 

						Classes might be declined because they fundamentally don't fit our Class Guidelines. If

						your class is declined, you'll have a chance to ask us. If you forget something crucial that 

						could have led to a misinterpretation of your class, please make sure to mention that in 

						your query.</p>

                        <p>An ‘activity date’ is the date which the class officially takes place with the participants.<br><br>
                        In the period between the class date being launched and the activity date, you can use 

						the ‘Community Thread’ board to communicate with the participants about any related 

						issues or answer questions.<br><br>
						Instructors do not have to answer every question participants ask, but it will help them 

						to manage the group better if they stay close to their participants.<br><br>
						After an activity date of a class is launched, Evercise will email and notify you with the 

						link to the class’s page, all your classes can be found on your profile page (past, present 

						and future). The link you receive from Evercise can be used to advertise and promote 

						your class (s) on various social media and advertising sites.<br><br>
						If you can't fulfil the promises and obligations you have made, full responsibility falls

						upon you to contact all the participants who are effected by your actions and ensure the 

						matter is resolved professionally and promptly .i.e. late cancellations</p>

						(only if they do not currently own a PayPal account). Full completion of this registration

                        All PayPal payments will be visible within the Instructors account within 14 days of that

                        <p>You will receive an incentivised profit-share with the fees that have been paid in through

						the site. The most Evercise will retain from a successful class is 10% with the opportunity 

						for you to only be charged as low as 5% if simple monthly targets are reached. There is 

						a payment processing fee of around 3-5% charged by PayPal.<br><br>
                        Evercise will choose various classes on occasions which we feel are extremely creative, 

						popular and different to be placed in our ‘Featured Classes’ section for greater exposure. 

						We believe that if instructors make fitness more fun and engaging, it will also be more 

						effective. This will also be used to help promote new instructors who have recently 

						joined and wish to expand their client reach. The choices will be made with significant 

						consideration as they will appear on the home page when potential participants visit 

						Evercise.</p>
