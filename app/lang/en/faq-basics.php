<p>Evercise is an online platform that connects everyone wanting to exercise in a class with a wide array of instructors and classes all over London.<br><br>
With Evercise, you can choose your class by location, provider and specificity. Once
booked, you will receive automatic confirmation of your booking with all the necessary
details. When an instructor creates an event on Evercise, only maximum participant’s 
numbers are required and the instructor is obliged to perform the class even if only one 
person has enrolled.<br><br>
All classes on the Evercise site whether big or small will consist of various tags chosen 
by the event creator, the Instructor and provider. These aid the participant to fasten 
the search for their preferred interest (s). All classes on the site will be screened and 
available for all to see.</p>

<p>Evercise will strive to lower the risks for all participants by screening professionals 
upon signing-up, provide an instructor rating system with comments for participants to 
have their say (good or bad) and for any complaints/queries to be dealt with as soon 
as possible. Evercise cannot guarantee all events will run accordingly but ensures all 
participants can ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a group by whether 
they decide to join it or not.<br><br>
It&apos;s the instructor’s responsibility to provide and complete their class in a professional 
manner. Evercise is not directly responsible or involved in providing the professionals
service themselves.<br><br>
We encourage all our instructors to upload their website details in order to demonstrate 
their accountability.<br><br>
Evercise&apos;s &apos;Terms of Use&apos; require instructors to fulfil all services of their class or refund 
any and all participants whose service they did not or cannot fulfil (All instructors will 
see these terms before they confirm the class details). These terms are to create a legal 
requirement for instructors/creators to follow through on their provision of classes and 
services.<br><br>
Evercise doesn&apos;t issue refunds as transactions are between participants and the 
instructor directly. Instructors receive all funds (minus Evercise&apos;s minimal fee) soon 
after their class has been performed. Instructors have the ability to refund participants 
through PayPal and Evercise. We advise participants who are unsuccessful in claiming a 
refund owed to them to contact Evercise directly.</p>
