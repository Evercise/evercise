            will review it against our &apos;Class Guideline. We will let you know if it&apos;s suitable for the site, 

            needs a little work or if doesn&apos;t meet the requirements of Evercise. We&apos;ll get back to you 

            within two working days on average and if changes are required. We will let you know 

            and then re-review your group once it’s been updated. We recommend instructors to 

            Classes might be declined because they fundamentally don&apos;t fit our Class Guidelines. If

            your class is declined, you&apos;ll have a chance to ask us. If you forget something crucial that 

            could have led to a misinterpretation of your class, please make sure to mention that in 

            your query.</p>

<p>An &apos;activity date&apos; is the date which the class officially takes place with the participants.<br><br>
In the period between the class date being launched and the activity date, you can use 

the ‘Community Thread’ board to communicate with the participants about any related 

issues or answer questions.<br><br>
Instructors do not have to answer every question participants ask, but it will help them 

to manage the group better if they stay close to their participants.<br><br>
After an activity date of a class is launched, Evercise will email and notify you with the 

link to the class’s page, all your classes can be found on your profile page (past, present 

and future). The link you receive from Evercise can be used to advertise and promote 

your class (s) on various social media and advertising sites.<br><br>
If you can&apos;t fulfil the promises and obligations you have made, full responsibility falls

upon you to contact all the participants who are effected by your actions and ensure the 

matter is resolved professionally and promptly .i.e. late cancellations</p>

individual questions or requests on this board. It can act as a notice board to post any

<p>You will receive an incentivised profit-share with the fees that have been paid in through

the site. The most Evercise will retain from a successful class is 10% with the opportunity 

for you to only be charged as low as 5% if simple monthly targets are reached. There is 

a payment processing fee of around 3-5% charged by PayPal.<br><br>
Evercise will choose various classes on occasions which we feel are extremely creative, 

popular and different to be placed in our ‘Featured Classes’ section for greater exposure. 

We believe that if instructors make fitness more fun and engaging, it will also be more 

effective. This will also be used to help promote new instructors who have recently 

joined and wish to expand their client reach. The choices will be made with significant 

consideration as they will appear on the home page when potential participants visit 

Evercise.</p>
