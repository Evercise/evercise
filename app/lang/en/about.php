<p>At Evercise we don&apost underestimate the motivational power of camaraderie. <br>
Exercising in a group inspires greater willpower and discipline, and therefore greater results! <br>
It significantly reduces the cost of the class per participant,<br>
and because there are so many people wanting so many different things, <br>
there is a huge variety of classes to choose from.<br>Use our Evercise community to find people with similar fitness requirements, <br>
and a trainer to suit those requirements. <br>
From the moment you book a class you can talk to other members of the class <br>
and the trainer through the <i>Community Thread.</i> Share your experiences, write reviews and club together to request more classes from the same trainer.</p>
